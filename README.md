Arduino code to demonstrate sending a signal from an Adafruit Feather using a button to detect user input.

If the button is pressed, an alternating HIGH and LOW signal is sent out over the xmitPin every 250ms and the onboard LED flashes. If the button is not pressed, the onboard LED flashes once per second.
